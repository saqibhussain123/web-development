<!-- Promises in JavaScript
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions.

Key Points
States of a Promise:

Pending: The initial state; the operation is ongoing.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed.
Creating a Promise:

You can create a Promise using the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const success = true; // Simulating success or failure
    if (success) {
        resolve("Operation successful!");
    } else {
        reject("Operation failed.");
    }
}); -->
<!-- Consuming a Promise:

You can handle the results of a Promise using .then() for fulfillment and .catch() for rejection.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
myPromise
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result); // Outputs: Operation successful!
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.log(error); // Outputs: Operation failed.
    });
Chaining Promises:

You can chain multiple .then() calls to handle sequential asynchronous operations.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched!");
        }, 1000);
    });
};

fetchData()
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data); // Outputs: Data fetched!
        return "Processing data...";
    })
    .then(result => {
        console.log(result); // Outputs: Processing data...
    });
Promise.all():

Promise.all() allows you to execute multiple Promises in parallel and waits for all of them to resolve or for any to reject.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
    .then(values => {
        console.log(values); // Outputs: [3, 42, "foo"]
    });
Summary
Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, making the code more readable and manageable.
They have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
You can chain them and use Promise.all() to handle multiple asynchronous operations together. -->
