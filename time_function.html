1. setInterval()
Definition: This function repeatedly calls a specified function at set intervals (in milliseconds).
Usage: It continues to execute until it's stopped with clearInterval().
Syntax:

const intervalId = setInterval(callback, delay);
Example:
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('This message is logged every second');
}, 1000);



2. setTimeout()
Definition: This function executes a specified function after a delay (in milliseconds).
Usage: It only runs once unless called again.
Syntax:

const timeoutId = setTimeout(callback, delay);
Example:

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('This message is logged after 2 seconds');
}, 2000);


3. Date
Definition: The Date object in JavaScript is used to work with dates and times.
Usage: It can create date objects, retrieve current dates, and manipulate date values.
Example:
const now = new Date(); // Current date and time

4. getDay()
Definition: This method returns the day of the week for a given date, where 0 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.
Usage: It is called on a Date object.
Syntax:

const dayOfWeek = today.getDay();
console.log(dayOfWeek); // Outputs a number (0-6) representing the day

5. toString()
Definition: This method converts a date object into a human-readable string format.
Usage: It is called on a Date object and returns a string representation of the date.
Example:

const now = new Date();
console.log(now.toString()); // Outputs the date in a readable format
Summary
setInterval(): Repeatedly calls a function at specified intervals.
setTimeout(): Calls a function once after a specified delay.
Date: Object for handling dates and times.
getDay(): Retrieves the day of the week from a Date object.
toString(): Converts a Date object into a readable string format.
These functions and methods are commonly used in JavaScript for managing time, dates, and asynchronous operations!
